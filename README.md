I'm currently doing my PhD in computer science. My research topic is privacy in second layer payment networks (mainly Lightning Network). So most of my (private) repos are either papers that I plan to publish some day, or tools needed to do my research.

I try to contribute to open source projects that I use in my own projects. Stuff like JSTransformers, Nuxt, MermaidJS, and obviously also Lightning related stuff.(I secretly prefer JS even for my research; Yes, I know I should probably use Python more, ...or R, ... or C++)

I have two personal OS projects that I spend time on whenever I can. I have moved them under to an [organization](https://github.com/neumannjs), because hopefully at some time in the future loads of people will be contributing. The first project is [Boilerplate Paper](https://github.com/neumannjs/boilerplate-paper) which is a tool for creating scientific papers, posters and slideshows in Markdown and convert them to different formats like LaTeX, Pdf, Word, PowerPoint or Html. The second project is still a it under wraps, so stay tuned...
