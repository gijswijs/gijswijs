I'm interested in privacy and security in Lightning Network. So most of my (private) repos are either papers that I plan to publish some day, or tools needed to do my research. Professionally I am a security engineer for Lightning Labs and contribute to their products such as LND and Taproot Assets.

I have two personal OS projects that I spend time on whenever I can. I have moved them under an [organization](https://github.com/neumannjs "NeumannJS"), because hopefully at some time in the future loads of people will be contributing. The first project is [Boilerplate Paper](https://github.com/neumannjs/boilerplate-paper "creating scientific papers, posters and presentations in markdown and convert them to LaTeX, PDF, Powerpoint and HTML with Boilerplate Paper") which is a tool for creating scientific papers, posters and slideshows in Markdown and convert them to different formats like LaTeX, Pdf, Word, PowerPoint or Html. The second project is a port of MetalSmith static site generator, called [Janos](https://github.com/neumannjs/Janos "Janos, Browser based Static Site Generator that runs on Github Pages"),  that runs entirely in the browser and is tightly integrated with Github and Github Pages so that it is hosted for free.

I post about my research and open source projects on my personal website at [gijsvandam.nl](https://www.gijsvandam.nl "Gijs van Dam's personal website") which is (obviously) a Janos website itself.
