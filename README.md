I'm currently doing my PhD in computer science. My research topic is privacy in second layer payment networks (mainly Lightning Network). So most of my (private) repos are either papers that I plan to publish some day, or tools needed to do my research.

I try to contribute to open source projects that I use in my own projects. Stuff like JSTransformers, Nuxt, MermaidJS, and obviously also Lightning related stuff.(I secretly prefer JS even for my research; Yes, I know I should probably use Python more, ...or R, ... or C++)

I have two personal OS projects that I spend time on whenever I can. I have moved them under an [organization](https://github.com/neumannjs), because hopefully at some time in the future loads of people will be contributing. The first project is [Boilerplate Paper](https://github.com/neumannjs/boilerplate-paper "creating scientific papers, posters and presentations in markdown and convert them to LaTeX, PDF, Powerpoint and HTML with Boilerplate Paper") which is a tool for creating scientific papers, posters and slideshows in Markdown and convert them to different formats like LaTeX, Pdf, Word, PowerPoint or Html. The second project is a port of MetalSmith static site generator, called [Janos](https://github.com/neumannjs/Janos "Janos, Browser based Static Site Generator that runs on Github Pages"),  that runs entirely in the browser and is tightly integrated with Github and Github Pages so that it is hosted for free.
